# large-language model (LLM)

Recently, I read some papers, and I found one commonality that they treat protein data as text data. The natural language processing (NLP) methods are highly


I would like to keep sharing what I am learning.

## Simulating 500 million years of evolution with a language model 
> Here we show that language models trained on tokens generated by evolution can act as evolutionary simulators to generate functional proteins that are far away from known proteins. 

> We present ESM3, a frontier **multimodal generative language model** that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins.

> . Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at far distance (58% identity) from known fluorescent proteins. Similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are separated by over five hundred million years of evolution
