# large-language model (LLM)

Recently, I read some papers, and I found one commonality that they treat protein data as text data. The natural language processing (NLP) methods seem highly transferable to the computational biology[cite]. For example, the **Tansformer** model is specially effective for language understanding, such as the language translation. ESM3 smartly used the mechanisms of Transformer in its own model and specially for the protein task.
> A consensus is developing that underlying these sequences is a fundamental language of protein biology that can be understood using language models (6–11)


I would like to keep sharing what I am learning.

## Simulating 500 million years of evolution with a language model 
In *Introduction* section, authors state why they started this work.
> A number of language models of protein sequences have now been developed and evaluated (5–10, 12–17). It has been found that the representations that emerge within language models reflect the biological structure and function of proteins (6–8, 18), and are learned without any supervision on those properties (19, 20), improving with scale (5, 21). In the field of artificial intelligence, scaling laws have been found that predict the growth in capabilities with increasing scale, describing a frontier in compute, parameters, and data.



> Here we show that language models trained on tokens generated by evolution can act as evolutionary simulators to generate functional proteins that are far away from known proteins. 

> We present ESM3, a frontier **multimodal generative language model** that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins.

> . Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at far distance (58% identity) from known fluorescent proteins. Similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are separated by over five hundred million years of evolution
