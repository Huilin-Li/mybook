## Glossary

| term    | knowledge |
| -------- | ------- |
| alleles  | 等位基因, a gene can exit in different forms called alleles. e.g. the pea can have either yellow or green seeds. One allele of the gene for seed color gives rise to yellow seeds, the other to green. Moreover, one allele can be dominant over the other, recessive, allele.|
| dominat, recessive |  显性， 隐性 | 
| transmission genetics | 传播遗传学 |
| blending | 混合 |
| progeny |  后代 |
| phenotype |  表型， observable characteristic, Greek root: phemomenon, meaning appearance. exhibit the tall phenotype/appearance. refer to the whole set of observable characteristics of an organism |
| filial generation F1, F2 ...|  子代, filial comes from the Latin: filius=son, filia=daughter.|
| self-fertilize | 自花授粉 |
| diploid | 二倍体, the parents were diploid | 
| homozygotes | 纯合子，homozygotes have two copies of the same allele. |
| heterozygotes | 杂合子, heterozygotes have one copy of each allele. |
| haploid | 单倍体, sex cells contain only one copy of the gene; that is, thay are haploid. |
| gametes |  配子, or sex cells |
| cell nucleus | 细胞核 |










## Expression
1. inheritance is particulate
2. each parent contributes particles, or genetic units, to the offspring. We now call these particles genes.
3. the allele for green seeds must have been preserved in the F1 generation.
