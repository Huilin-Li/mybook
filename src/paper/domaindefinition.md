# domain definition
 If I have protein dataset, and I can perform cluster analysis, then, how to define or decide to say this set of (parts of) sequences is much worthy for us to do wet-lab experiments, in order to discover new domains.

 > Structure-guided discovery of ancestral CRISPR-Cas13 ribonucleases
1. automated structureal-search pipeline
    * identify an ancestral clade of Cas13 (Cas13an).
    * trace Cas13 origins to defense-associated ribonucleases.
2. Cas13an is 1/3 size of other Cas13s
3. Cas13an mediates: 1) robust programmable RNA depletion and 2) defense against diverse bacteriophages
4. **pipeline:** 
    1) leveraged a Fold seek-clustered AlphaFold database (20), whose reduced search space makes slow-but-sensitive DALI searches feasible. **DALI server**: [link](http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/)
    2) Using representative HEPN dimers within known Cas13 proteins (21–23) as the search query, we found twelve previously uncharacterized protein clusters in the AlphaFold database bearing an intramolecular HEPN dimer (fig. S1 and tables S1 and S2).
    3) Further sequence-based homology searches and genomic analyses revealed that two of the newly identified clusters occur next to CRISPR arrays, representing a new Cas13 subtype (Cas13an) (Fig. 1A and fig. S2)
    4) Notably, neither Foldseek nor hidden Markov model searches were able to detect significant homology between previously known Cas13s and Cas13an (fig. S3). 
    5) This highlights the considerable divergence of Cas13an compared to known Cas13 proteins, and underscores the importance of sensitive search strategies.
### Structural-search and novel CRISPR system identification pipeline
1. By manually examining the structures of previously characterized Cas13 subtypes, researchers curated the conserved intramolecular HEPN dimer core. (**as the conserved domain**)
2. get 4 examples (Cas13a, Cas13b, and Cas13d, and Cas13c)
3. The HEPN core regions were isolated from the Cas13 protein structures using ChimeraX (44).
4. The HEPN core regions are used as queries in DALI. 
> To search against the entirety of the AlphaFold database (~200 million structures) (14), DALI’s slow performance presented a major bottleneck. To circumvent this, the search was performed against the **~2.3 million cluster representatives** generated by clustering the AlphaFold database with Foldseek 
5. **~2.3 million cluster representatives** were subdivided into batches that each contained 1000 structures, resulting in a total of 2304 batches.
6. After completing DALI-searches against the AlphaFold database, only hits with the signature Rx4H motif of HEPN domains and a DALI Z-score greater than 6 were retained.
7. Finally, only hits that also bear an intramolecular HEPN dimer were considered as Cas13 candidates.
